  We created an RTS with a huge inspiration from frostPunk. It was my second big project after A Sacrifice For The
  Turquoise Lord and was the first one with a potential huge workload and with some complex mechanics.

***Description :*** 

This game is an RTS with gameplay very similar to Frostpunk. The aim of the game is to balance the happiness
of humans and dragons, who will arrive little by little over the course of the game.

To achieve this, the player will have to make choices through various events and manage the village efficiently
by exploiting and producing the resources needed to sustain the village.

If you want to test it, don't hesitate to ask me, I have the build but it is on the perforce of our school.
