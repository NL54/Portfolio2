***Description :***

This is a puzzle game whose main mechanic is that each time the player dies,
a temporal double redoes the actions he performed before dying. Meanwhile the player can play
alongside this double. It's possible to have multiple doubles but the player has limited lives. 

The aim is to use the temporal doubles wisely to get past the Turquoise Lord's puzzles.
